# BRCA1_Variant_Analysis

## Overview
Python analysis of BRCA1 variants

## Data
- Source: [ClinVar](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/)

## Methods
- Python (pandas, seaborn, matplotlib)

## Results
- Many VUS have not been evaluated recently and need re-evaluation
- Identified intronic variants with dbSNP ids that have not been re-evaluated recently for re-evaluation (likely benign)
- Visualized region of clustered variants

## Future Work
- Explore the variants within the identified clustered region
- Integrate AI/ML for variant classification
